0. How to Translate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install gettext
* fork the lincity-ng repo and do the usual autogen.sh, configure.
  Make sure configure can find the xgettext application.
    (ie. "checking for xgettext... xgettext")
* Run 'jam', let it compile. It should create data/locale/messages.pot and
  data/locale/gui/messages.pot files
* Go into data/locale and data/locale/gui and in each dir do:
     - In case you want to create a new translation do
        msginit -i messages.pot -o $LANG.po
       (where $LANG is the 2character handle of your language)
     - In case you want to update an existing translation do
        msgmerge -U $LANG.po messages.pot
* Edit the .po files with your favourite Editor or with one of the GUI tools
  below.
* Commit/push the changes to your fork and open a pull request agains master.
* If you want to edit the help texts, then create a directory with your language
  shortcut in the data/help directory (e.g. data/help/de) and write new xml
  files in your language (similar to the ones in the data/help/en directory).
  You don't need to copy over the english texts, the game will automatically use
  the english version of a text if no translated version exists.
* You should also edit the lincity-ng.desktop file and add a comment entry for
  your language

2. GUI Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Virtaal     - a free multi-platform editor with TM that can handle multiple
               translation formats (runs under Windows, Unix and Mac).
               URL: http://virtaal.translatehouse.org/
 KBabel      - a long dated KDE program that has been maturing over the years,
               and it's really handy by now.
 poEdit      - a multi-platform po editor (runs under Windows and Unix).
               URL: http://poedit.sourceforge.net/
 (X)Emacs    - a commonly used program for translating with the respective
               plugin.
 QTranslator - made by Qt, has the advantage of running in several platforms.
               PO files are written in ASCII and are pretty intuitive, so they
               can be used by any text editor. But it would be wise to use a
               program made for that effect. If not possible, use a text editor
               with highlighting for PO files.
